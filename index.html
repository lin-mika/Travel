            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>  My family and I love to travel. In fact I was on my first airplane when I was two months old. 
I have been to 
-America
-Canada
-Cambodia
-China
-Denmark
-England
-Estonia
-Finland
-France
-Germany
-Italy
-Japan
-Korea
-Portugal
-Russia
-Scotland
-Spain
-Sweden
-Taiwan
Some of my favourite places Iâ€™ve been are Italy and Japan. The scenery at Italy is super pretty and the food in Japan is delicious. My all time favourite place would have to be Taiwan because I grew up there and Taiwan has mountains, beaches, forests, not to mention a lot of night markets with delicious food.</p>
