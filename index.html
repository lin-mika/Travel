            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>  My family and I love to travel. In fact I was on my first airplane when I was two months old. 
<br>I have been to 
<br>-America
<br>-Canada
<br>-Cambodia
<br>-China
<br>-Denmark
<br>-England
<br>-Estonia
<br>-Finland
<br>-France
<br>-Germany
<br>-Italy
<br>-Japan
<br>-Korea
<br>-Portugal
<br>-Russia
<br>-Scotland
<br>-Spain
<br>-Sweden
<br>-Taiwan
<br>Some of my favourite places Iâ€™ve been are Italy and Japan. The scenery at Italy is super pretty and the food in Japan is delicious. My all time favourite place would have to be Taiwan because I grew up there and Taiwan has mountains, beaches, forests, not to mention a lot of night markets with delicious food.</p>
