            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>  My family and I love to travel. In fact I was on my first airplane when I was two months old. 
<br>I have been to：
America, Canada, Cambodia, China, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Portugal, Russia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, and finally Taiwan
<br>Some of my favourite places I’ve been are Italy and Japan. The scenery at Italy is super pretty and the food in Japan is delicious. My all time favourite place would have to be Taiwan because I grew up there and Taiwan has mountains, beaches, forests, not to mention a lot of night markets with delicious food.</p>
